    <h1>On OPSEC during protests (by @sinwindie)</h1>

<p>As someone who specializes in tracking and unmasking individuals, here are some very basic #OPSEC tips for those of you exercising your right to protest.</p>

<p>Before we begin, let me clarify that in my career as an investigator / analyst I only focus on -REAL- criminals. Protesting is not a crime and though we should be protected while protesting it is clear that under some jurisdictions this will not be the case.</p>

<p>First off, we should talk about clothing. You want to wear something comfortable without drawing attention to yourself or making yourself easily identifiable within the crowd. Concealing any identifiable scars, marks, or tattoos and wearing a mask is the bare minimum.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t wear anything to make yourself stick out in a crowd, such as unique or memorable colors or clothing. This will draw attention to you in any video or photographs and allow your movements and actions to be more easily identified and tracked across the event and its coverage.</p>

<p>This is especially a problem if you regularly wear that item of clothing and/or have public photos of yourself wearing it. Investigators WILL look at public coverage of the event and cross reference them against SocMed profile for possible matches in order to identify users.</p>

<p>Hats, glasses, shoes, and accessories like backpacks or masks are the types of clothing articles I search the most for this. Avoid logos or text that point to specific schools, groups, affiliations, cities, or locations as it helps investigators narrow down their searching area.</p>

<p>Speaking of SocMed, lock your accounts down as much as possible, like now. Public profiles and posts make it far easier for LE to search for and identify you. Also, tell your friends and family to do the same if they are also posting or sharing details or photos of the protests.</p>

<p>If you locked your accounts down but were tagged by a friend who&#39;s account was public, you&#39;re probably still hosed. While it is best not to share any details or photos online in the first place, I realize that many will still do so.</p>

<p>Searching public profiles is far easier than the steps needed to get information from a locked one. Don&#39;t make it easy for them. If you don&#39;t stick out (see above on clothing) then they will likely not bother with your locked account unless something else caught their attention.</p>

<p>Next, leave those electronic devices at home and for the love of all things holy do not search for things related to the protest or anything you may or may not do there. So much data is collected from devices which can be used to identify you.</p>

<p>Bringing your phone makes you susceptible to things like IMSI catchers. You can also be tracked and identified by what WiFi hotspots your phone makes connection requests to, related keyword searches on google, and your location history.</p>

<p>While we are on the topic of phones, all comms should be treated as if they already are compromised, or will be at some point in the future. Records, retention periods, and available data available via LE subpoena will vary depending on the messaging platform.</p>

<p>However, if no messages or records are exchanged there is nothing to subpoena. Do everything you can in person without any physical record (text, email, etc).</p>

<p>While encryption is a must for secure communications, it doesn&#39;t do much if the messages are retained in the clear on a device which is unlocked and seized by LE. Don&#39;t assume those you are corresponding with are taking the same precautions as you are.</p>

<p>All this being said, stay safe, don&#39;t stand out, help those around you, and keep fighting the good fight.</p>
