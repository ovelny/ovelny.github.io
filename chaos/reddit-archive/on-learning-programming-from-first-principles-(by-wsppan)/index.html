    <h1>On learning programming from first principles (by u/wsppan)</h1>

<p>There are two schools of thought. Some believe you start from the highest degree of abstraction where you don&#39;t have to think about memory (what it is, how it is created, how it is managed, how it is destroyed, etc..) or data types, or data structures (how they are built, how they map to memory, etc..) and you are given all the building blocks to quickly build some decent applications. Python is lingua franca in this approach and you can go pretty far with pathways into OO and even forays into functional programming concepts to make some pretty sophisticated applications.</p>

<p>The second school of thought is to start from first principles. Study how computers really work. How they process data, store data, perform calculations, etc.. This involves understanding memory (stack, heap, registers, call stack), and boolean logic. You then use this understanding to build abstractions on top of this (arrays, hashes, linked lists, objects, etc..) You keep building up you abstractions from logic tables, to assembly, to usually C where by this time you are pretty high up the abstraction pyramid.</p>

<p>I am a firm believer in the second approach. There are no shortcuts in this field and the first approach makes you think you are taking one. If you do not learn these first principles then you will find yourself hitting a brick wall once your applications hit the limits of your CS knowledge and the limits of these higher level languages when it comes to code correctness and efficiency as your problem domain scales. Once you learn these first principles then adding any new language to your toolbelt is more manageable. Especially languages like C++ or Rust where these core principles like memory management are not hidden from you.</p>

<p>Check out these resources. This is hard stuff. It&#39;s supposed to be. Otherwise anybody can do it by simply learning the syntax of an &quot;easy&quot; language.</p>
