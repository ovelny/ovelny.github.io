      <p>I’ve been reacquainting myself with hackthebox’s academy modules for the last 2 weeks. I’m glad to notice that not everything has been lost, far from it.

      <p>My last contract has ended and I finally have enough time to re-study for the OSCP. I had a lot of fun with it back in early 2023, but sadly I wasn’t able to keep working towards the certification with a new full-time job at the time.</p><p>There’s no doubt I’m quite rusty and I need to refresh my machines and setup first. Still, watching IppSec’s videos and remembering the thrill of hacking is exciting. This should be fun even if I have to re-earn the bonus points I worked for.</p><p>A few other things happened on the not-so-fun side of things, but all that matters is that i want to get back on track (•ᴗ•)</p><ul><li>Still learning C. I’ve switched to Effective C rather than Beej’s guide, as it challenges me to understand underlying concepts.</li><li>Updating my machines and attack box.</li><li>Reading <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_in_Yellow>The King in Yellow</a>.</li><li>Having fun playing Doom (1993). I never took a decent shot at it before!</li><li>Added alt text for all media files on here. This took me a while and I will always be doing this as i write posts from now on.</li><li>Added an <a href=https://ovelny.sh/about/>about page</a>.</li><li>Added a fitting <a href=https://ovelny.sh/license/>license</a> for this site.</li><li>Renamed my wikis: my cybersecurity wiki is now “chaos” and my personal one is “phasm”.</li><li>Read, watched and played a few things since the previous update, all listed on <a href=https://ovelny.sh/phasm/>phasm</a>.</li><li>Sorted things out with my current status as a returning OSCP student.</li></ul>

      <p>Many changes since last month. I decided to study C instead of Rust as this will be the most practical, useful choice for me and I’m having a lot of fun learning the underlying concepts.</p><p>It’s so interesting to me that i don’t want to risk losing the guides I’m using: since mirroring them seems to be okay, I added <a href="https://ovelny.sh/chaos/beej's-guide-to-c-programming/">Beej’s guide to C programming</a> and <a href="https://ovelny.sh/chaos/beej's-guide-to-c-%E2%80%94-library-reference/">Beej’s library reference</a> to <a href=https://ovelny.sh/chaos/>chaos</a>, along with other <a href=https://ovelny.sh/chaos/c-programming-resources/>C resources</a>.</p><p>I hope copying them as I did is allowed. I also added <a href="https://ovelny.sh/chaos/tutorials/mirroring-Beej's-guides/">how I’ve done it in the tutorials</a>.</p><ul><li>Still fixing some broken links in the wikis and contact page.</li><li>Adding an about page.</li><li>Learning C.</li><li>Reading Stefan Stenudd’s translation of Tao Te Ching: Ursula K. Le Guin’s rendition is amazing, but I found myself needing a more down-to-earth version.</li><li>Updating my VM so I can study again for the OSCP.</li><li>Moved nanoc and all its dependencies to an independant, locally backed up docker image.</li><li>Wrote a bash script to control static site generation solely from this docker image.</li></ul>

      <p>I’ve changed this section and made it a <code>now</code> page, that I will update regularly to track what I’m doing. This week has somehow been both uneventful and overwhelming: I’m catching up on the past few months with boring things like paperwork, but also updating this website and re-learning rust. I stopped at the worst time, my pace was very satisfying and concepts like traits were finally clicking. Thankfully <a href=https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/>this interactive version of the rust book</a> should help.</p><p>I’m also preparing myself to study again for the OSCP. A daunting process, I hate being rusty after leaving something for too long.</p><ul><li>Fixing some broken links in the wikis and contact page.</li><li>Documenting <a href=https://ovelny.sh/chaos/rust/>rust concepts</a> while re-learning.</li><li>Moving all the dependencies of this site’s static generator (nanoc and more) into a docker image for resiliency and “portability”.</li><li>Added <a href=https://ovelny.sh/phasm/>phasm wiki</a> to the site, so I can document everything unrelated to computers.</li><li>Changed this site’s CSS to use InconsolataGo font, after a disappointing attempt with bitmap fonts.</li><li>Read The Tao of Pooh, which left me with mixed feelings but enough interest to start reading the Tao Te Ching rendition by Ursula K. Le Guin.</li></ul>
