    <h1>Quotes</h1>

<p>A selection of quotes that sparkled something in me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.&quot;</p>

<p>— Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What is it about fire? So calm and peaceful but... inside, all power and destruction. It&#39;s hiding something. Just like people do. Sometimes you have to get close to find what&#39;s inside. Sometimes you have to get burned to see the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>— Taiyō Matsumoto, Tekkonkinkreet</p>
</blockquote>

<p><hr></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Don&#39;t threaten me, friend. My rage is just as twisted as my face.&quot;</p>

<p>— Taiyō Matsumoto, Tekkonkinkreet</p>
</blockquote>

<p><hr></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When the infinite possibilities of life have been reduced to an array of options coded in ones and zeros, there will be no more friction between the system we inhabit and the lives we can imagine — not because we will have achieved total freedom, but because we will have perfected its opposite. Freedom doesn&#39;t mean choosing between options, but formulating the questions.&quot;</p>

<p>— CrimethInc., To Change Everything</p>
</blockquote>

<p><hr></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The ontological fallacy of expecting a light at the end of the tunnel, well, that&#39;s what the preacher sells, same as a shrink. See, the preacher, he encourages your capacity for illusion. Then he tells you it&#39;s a fucking virtue. Always a buck to be had doing that, and it&#39;s such a desperate sense of entitlement, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p>— Nic Pizzolatto, True Detective</p>
</blockquote>

<p><hr></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The concept of waiting bewilders me. There are always deadlines, there are always ticking clocks.&quot;</p>

<p>— Sam Esmail, Mr. Robot</p>
</blockquote>

<p><hr></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You only have to impress yourself, not the [...] community. If we achieve the first, the latter will come naturally.&quot;</p>

<p>— 0nenine9, HackTheBox</p>
</blockquote>

<p><hr></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In a dream you saw a way to survive and you were full of joy.&quot;</p>

<p>— Jenny Holzer, exhibition title</p>
